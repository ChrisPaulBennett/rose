    <h2 id="suite-search">Locating Suites</h2>

    <h3 id="home">Checked out Suites</h3>

    <p>To see what suites you have checked out on your machine click the "Show 
    local suites" button in the address bar. This will display a list of all 
    the suites you have copies of on your machine relating to the current 
    repository you are viewing. For help on switching to a different repository 
    see <a href="#repo-change">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>When running searches, suites you have copies of checked out will have 
    an icon in the "local" column of the search results indicating the status
    of the local copy e.g. modified, older, newer etc. If no icon is shown 
    then no local copy of that suite has been found.</p>

    <h3 id="search">Search</h3>
    
    <p>The simplest method available for locating suites is to use the search 
    function. Type a word or phrase into the search box and either click the 
    search button or press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and a search will be run for suites
    containing the entered word/phrase in <strong>any</strong> of their fields.
    </p>
    
    <p>The same behaviour can also be obtained by typing search phrases in the 
    address box - similar to many web browsers. Note that the search phrase 
    entered in the address box should not begin "http" or it will be 
    interpreted as a url. Should you wish to search for words/phrases beginning
    "http" then you will need to use the search box.</p>
    
    <h3 id="query">Running a query</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Show/hide - Query panel</li>
        <li>Set filter</li>
        <li>Add filter</li>
        <li>Remove filter</li>
        <li>Clear all filters</li>
        <li>Advanced controls for bracketed queries</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3 id="url">Using a url</h3>
    
    <p></p>
    
    <h3 id="history">Re-running past searches</h3>
    
    <p>As you run various suite searches within <kbd>rosie go</kbd> they are 
    recorded in your search history. To view your history, either click 
    "History -> Show search history" or use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl-H
    </kbd></p>
    
    <p>The Search History panel should now be displayed on the left-hand side 
    of <kbd>rosie go</kbd> listing your past searches with their <strong>
    type</strong> - "search", "query" or "url", the <strong>parameters</strong>
    you used and whether or not you asked for <strong>all revisions</strong> 
    of the returned suites to be shown.</p>
    
    <p>You can order the results by type, parameters or whether you asked to 
    see all revisions by clicking on the relevent column head.</p>
    
    <p>To re-run one of these searches simply click on it. The search will 
    then be set up and run.</p>
    
    <p>If you want to clear your search history then click "History -> Clear 
    history". You will be asked to confirm this.</p>
    
    <p>To close the history panel you can either close it by unticking "show 
    search history" in the History menu, using the keyboard shortcut or simply 
    clicking the close button at the top of the history panel.</p>
    
    <p><strong>N.B.</strong> <kbd>rosie go</kbd> only stores a limited number 
    of past searches (100 by default) so older, less used searches will 
    disappear from the history menu as new ones are run.</p>

    Basic run and run with options
    
    <h2 id="view">Viewing suite information</h2>
    
    <h3 id="sort">Ordering results</h3>

    <p>Search results can be ordered by field in either ascending or descending
    order. To do so, click on the column title for the field you wish to order
    by so an arrow is displayed next to it indicating the order in which the 
    field is being sorted.</p>
    
    <h3 id="column-view">Show/hide result fields</h3>
    
    <p></p>

    <h3 id="all-revisions">Viewing all revisions of a suite</h3>
    
    <p>To view all revisions of a suite in the repository you can either toggle
    the "View all revisions" box in the toolbar or click "View -> toggle all 
    revisions" and then run your search. Checking the "View all revisions" box 
    will not update the current results.</p>

    <h3 id="info">Getting more information about a suite</h3>
    
    <p>To obtain more information about a suite in the search results you can 
    do one of two things; hold your mouse over the suite to display the tooltip
    containing more details or right click on the suite and click "info" in the
    pop-up menu to display a dialog box containing further details.</p>
    
    <h2 id=other>Other features</h2>

    <h3 id="refresh">Refresh results</h3>
    
    <p>From time to time you may find you want to refresh the search results 
    being shown - perhaps as a result of collaborating on suite development.
    To do so either click the refresh button on the address bar, or use the 
    keyboard shortcut <kbd>F5</kbd>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="navigation">Search Navigation</h3>
    
    <p>While <kbd>rosie go</kbd> is open it keeps track of the various searches
    you run and allows you to navigate back to previous searches. By clicking 
    on the back and forward arrows you can navigate through the searches you 
    have run in the current session. Alternatively, you can make use of the 
    keyboard shortcuts <kbd>Ctrl-left</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl-right</kbd> to move
    backwards and forwards respectively.
    
    <h3 id="repo-change">Switching Repository</h3>
    
    <p><kbd>rosie go</kbd> enables you to search for suites stored in different 
    repositories by allowing you to swap between different sources. To change 
    repository click on "Edit -> Data source" and then the name of the 
    repository you wish to work with. On changing repository, <kbd>rosie 
    go</kbd> will display your checked out suites for that repository.</p>
    
    <p>You can tell what repository you are currently in from the title bar - 
    "X - rosie go", where X is the name of the repository - and from the data 
    source shown in the left hand side of the status bar at the bottom of the 
    window.</p>
