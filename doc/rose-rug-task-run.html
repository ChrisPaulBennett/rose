    <h1>Rose User Guide: Running Tasks</h1>

    <div id="content"></div>

    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <p>This chapter of the user guide discusses the Rose suite tools and
    utilities that can be used to simplify the logic of a suite and/or provide
    a common approach of doing the same things.</p>

    <h2 id="rose-task-run">rose task-run</h2>

    <p>The <code>rose task-run</code> command selects and launches an
    application (according to an application configuration) under the
    environment of a job (of a task) in a suite.</p>

    <p>See <a href="rose-command.html#rose-task-run">Rose Reference Guide: CLI
    &gt; rose task-run</a> for a full command reference.</p>

    <p>See <a href="rose-configuration.html#format">Rose Reference Guide:
    Configuration &gt; Configuration Format</a> for more information on the Rose
    configuration format.</p>

    <p>See <a href="rose-configuration.html#app">Rose Reference Guide:
    Configuration &gt; Application Configuration</a> for more information on
    how to set up a Rose application configuration.</p>

    <h3 id="rose-task-run.work-dir">Working Directory</h3>

    <p>The working directory of a task is dependent on the suite engine. For a
    task running under Cylc, the working directory of a task is normally
    <var>$ROSE_SUITE_DIR/work/$ROSE_TASK_NAME.$ROSE_TASK_CYCLE_TIME/</var>,
    (or <var>$ROSE_SUITE_DIR/work/$ROSE_TASK_NAME.1</var> for a non-cycling
    task.)</p>

    <p>The <code>rose task-run</code> (or the <code>rose app-run</code>) command
    also dumps out a <var>rose-app-run.conf</var> file in the working directory.
    The file contains the original <var>rose-app.conf</var> in the application
    configuration with any added optional configurations and command line
    settings set via <code>--define=[SECTION]NAME=VALUE</code>.</p>

    <h3 id="rose-task-run.app">Application Configuration Selection</h3>

    <p>The <code>rose task-run</code> command selects its application
    configuration with the following logic:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If the <code>--config=DIR</code> option is specified, it uses the
      value of <var>DIR</var> as the path to the application configuration
      directory.</li>

      <li>If the <code>--app-key=KEY</code> option is specified, it uses the
      <var>KEY</var> sub-directory under the suite's <var>app/</var> directory
      as the application configuration directory.</li>

      <li>If the <var>ROSE_TASK_APP=KEY</var> environment variable is specified,
      it uses the <var>KEY</var> sub-directory under the suite's <var>app/</var>
      directory as the application configuration directory.</li>

      <li>Finally, it looks at the suite's <var>app/</var> directory for an
      application configuration directory that matches the name of the
      task. (The command fails if it is unable to locate an application
      configuration.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="rose-task-run.env">Environment Variables Export</h3>

    <p>The <code>rose task-run</code> command exports a set of <var>ROSE_*</var>
    environment variables to its environment before doing anything. The list is
    documented in <a href="rose-command.html#rose-task-env">Rose Reference
    Guide: CLI &gt; rose task-env</a>.</p>

    <p>The <code>rose task-run</code> command also sets up the <var>PATH</var>
    environment variable, and if relevant other PATH-like environment variables,
    (e.g. <var>PYTHONPATH</var>). The following logic is applied in order:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The command looks for <var>[rose-task-run]path-prepend</var> (for
      <var>PATH</var>) or <var>[rose-task-run]path-prepend.NAME</var> (where
      <var>NAME</var> is the name of a PATH-like variable) settings in the
      site/user configuration files. The values of these settings are expected
      to be space delimited lists of directory paths. For each directory path,
      the command will check that it exists before prepending it to the
      relevant environment variable. E.g.:

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
[rose-task-run]
# Prepend /opt/hello/bin /opt/greeting/bin to $PATH
path-prepend=/opt/hello/bin /opt/greeting/bin
# Prepend /opt/stuff/lib/perl to $PERL5LIB
path-prepend.PERL5LIB=/opt/stuff/lib/perl
</pre>
      </li>

      <li>The command looks for directories under <var>$ROSE_SUITE_DIR</var>
      that match the glob patterns <code>share/fcm[_-]make*/*/bin</code>,
      <code>work/fcm[_-]make*/*/bin</code>. Matched directories are added to the
      <var>PATH</var> environment variable.</li>

      <li>The command accepts one or more <code>--path=[NAME=]PATTERN</code>
      command line option. Each of these specify a glob pattern for paths to
      prepend to an environment variable called <var>NAME</var> (or
      <var>PATH</var> if <var>NAME</var> is not specified). If a relative path
      is given, it is relative to <var>$ROSE_SUITE_DIR</var>. An empty value
      resets anything prepended in (1.) and (2.) above and any previous
      <code>--path=[NAME=]PATTERN</code> settings for the relevant environment
      variable.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The <code>rose task-run</code> command (or the <code>rose app-run</code>
    command) also exports each environment variables in the <var>[env]</var>
    section in the application configuration file. (The environment variables
    are exported in no particular oder, so they should not reference one
    another.) E.g.:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
[command]
default=echo "$HELLO $WORLDS"

[env]
HELLO=Greeting
WORLDS=Mars Jupiter Saturn
</pre>
    
    <p>Most other sections in the application configuration file, (e.g. the
    file installation sections and the application command) can reference the
    exported environment variables described above.</p>

    <p>Finally, if the application configuration has a <var>bin/</var>
    sub-directory, the <code>rose task-run</code> command (or the <code>rose
    app-run</code> command) will prepend its location in front of the
    <var>PATH</var> environment variable.</p>

    <h3 id="rose-task-run.file">File Installation</h3>

    <p>The <code>rose task-run</code> command (or the <code>rose app-run</code>
    command) can be configured to install files to the working directory or
    other locations in the suite. It does the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>It looks for <var>[file:*]</var> sections of the
      <var>rose-app.conf</var> file. See <a href=
      "rose-configuration.html#appendix-file-creation-mode">Rose Reference
      Guide: Configuration &gt; Appendix: File Creation Mode</a> for
      detail.</li>
    
      <li>Any regular files under the <var>file/</var> sub-directory of the
      application configuration will be copied to the working directory.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the command for the application requires some pre-defined standard
    input, a file called <var>STDIN</var> can be installed in the working
    directory. When the command is invoked, the content of the file will be
    piped to the standard input of the command.</p>

    <p>The <code>rose task-run</code> command (or the <code>rose app-run</code>
    command) caches file installation settings in the
    <var>.rose-config_processors-file.db</var> file in the working directory.
    This allows file installation to be <em>incremental</em>. If the task is run
    again, identical files will not have to be reinstalled.</p>

    <h3 id="rose-task-run.command">Command Selection</h3>

    <p>In command mode (default), the <code>rose task-run</code> command (or the
    <code>rose app-run</code> command) invokes a shell command. (Alternatively,
    the <code>rose task-run</code> command invokes a built-in application. See
    <a href="#rose-task-run.built-in-app">Built-in Applications Selection</a> for
    detail.) It uses the following logic to select a shell command to run:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If arguments are supplied to <code>rose task-run</code>, the
      arguments are run as a shell command.</li>

      <li>If the <code>--command-key=KEY</code> option is specified, the
      command specified in the <var>[command]KEY</var> setting in the
      application configuration file is used.</li>

      <li>If the <var>[command]</var> section in the application configuration
      file has a key matching the task name, the command specified in this
      setting is used.</li>

      <li>Otherwise, the command specified in the <var>[command]default</var>
      setting is used.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This mechanism allows, for example, similar tasks to share the same
    application configuration, if most of their differences can be defined at
    the command line.</p>

    <p>E.g.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
[command]
default=echo Hello World
hello_earth=echo Hello Earth
greet_martians=echo Greeting Martians
</pre>

    <p>In the above example, if the command key is <samp>hello_earth</samp>, the
    application will echo <samp>Hello Earth</samp>. If the command key is not
    defined, but the task name is <samp>greet_martians</samp>, the application
    will echo <samp>Greeting Martians</samp>. For any other tasks using this
    application configuration and if the command key is not defined, it will
    echo <samp>Hello World</samp>.</p>

    <h3 id="rose-task-run.built-in-app">Built-in Applications Selection</h3>

    <p>Apart from running a shell command, the <code>rose task-run</code>
    command (or the <code>rose app-run</code> command) may be configured to call
    a built-in application. To use a built-in application, add the
    <kbd>mode=KEY</kbd> top level setting in the application configuration,
    where <var>KEY</var> is the name of a built-in application. (Each built-in
    application is discussed individually later in this chapter.)</p>

    <p>A built-in application would normally behave very much like running an
    external command. The key differences are normally that:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>A built-in application may use a different working directory to a Rose
      application.</li>

      <li>A built-in application will run some pre-defined commands or logics
      instead of a command defined in the application configuration.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="rose-task-run.poll">Poll for Prerequisites</h3>

    <p>Prerequisites of a task should normally be defined at the suite level.
    However, there are times when it is more efficient to poll for a simple
    prerequisite before running a command. The <code>rose task-run</code>
    command (or the <code>rose app-run</code> command) provides a facility for
    tasks to poll for some prerequisites before running the application command.
    The facility supports 3 types of tests:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><dfn>Poll all files</dfn> This can be configured by adding the
      <var>[poll]all-files</var> setting in the application configuration file.
      The value of the setting is expected to be a list of space delimited list
      of file paths. This test passes only if all file paths in the list
      exist.</li>

      <li><dfn>Poll any files</dfn> This can be configured by adding the
      <var>[poll]any-files</var> setting in the application configuration file,
      as above. This test passes if any file path in the list exists.</li>

      <li><dfn>Poll with a shell command</dfn> This can be configured by adding
      the <var>[poll]test</var> setting in the application configuration file.
      The value of the setting is expected to be a shell command. This test
      passes if the command returns a 0 (zero) return code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Normally, both <var>all-files</var> and <var>any-files</var> test for the
    existence of file paths. If this is not enough, you can specify a
    <var>[poll]file-test</var> setting to run a command on each file.  E.g. if
    you want to test for the existence of a string in each file, you can do:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
all-files=file1 file2
file-test=test -e {} &amp;&amp; grep -q 'hello' {}
</pre>

    <p>At runtime, any <code>{}</code> pattern in the above is replaced with the
    name of the file. The above example checks that both <samp>file1</samp> and
    <samp>file2</samp> exist and that they both contain the string
    <samp>hello</samp>.</p>

    <p>By default, tests will only be performed once. If a list of
    <var>delays</var> is added, the tests will be performed a number of times
    with delays between them. If the prerequisites are still not met after the
    number of delays, <code>rose task-run</code> will fail with a time out. The
    delays list is a comma-separated list. The syntax looks like
    <var>[R*]T[U]</var>, where <var>U</var> is a unit (<kbd>s</kbd> for seconds
    (default), <kbd>m</kbd> for minutes and <kbd>h</kbd> for hours),
    <var>T</var> is the number of units, and <var>R</var> is the number of
    repeats. E.g.:</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
# Default
delays=0

# Poll 1 minute after the runner begins, repeat every minute 10 times
delays=10*1m

# Poll when runner begins,
# repeat every 10 seconds 6 times,
# repeat every minute 60 times,
# repeat once after 1 hour
delays=0,6*10s,60*1m,1h
</pre>

    <h2 id="rose-task-run.built-in-app.fcm_make">Built-in Application:
    fcm_make</h2>

    <p>The <code>fcm_make</code> built-in applications is provided for running
    <code>fcm make</code>.</p>

    <p>N.B. If a task has a name that starts with <var>fcm_make*</var>,
    <code>rose task-run</code> will run this built-in application.</p>

    <p>N.B. If a task has a name that starts with <var>fcm_make2*</var> and it
    does not have its own application configuration, <code>rose task-run</code>
    will attempt to associate it with the corresponding <var>fcm_make*</var>
    application configuration.</p>

    <p>The <code>fcm_make</code> application expects a file
    <var>file/fcm-make.cfg</var> in its application configuration. It runs
    <code>fcm make</code> using this configuration file.</p>

    <p>The <code>fcm make</code> application will also look for a matching
    <code>fcm_make2*</code> task in the suite which would normally be a
    continuation of the <code>fcm make</code> command as a separate
    <var>USER@HOST</var>. If so, will export an environment variable
    <var>ROSE_TASK_MIRROR_TARGET</var> to the <code>fcm make</code> command to
    substitute the mirror target.</p>

    <p>You can configure these applications with environment variables or
    settings in <var>rose-app.conf</var>. (Settings in <var>rose-app.conf</var>
    override their equivalent environment variables.)</p>

    <p><kbd>use-pwd=true</kbd>: By default, the application changes the working
    directory to <var>$ROSE_SUITE_DIR/share/$ROSE_TASK_NAME</var>. This option
    will stop this, and the working directory is the normal working directory
    of the task.</p>

    <p><kbd>opt.jobs=N</kbd> or the environment variable
    <var>ROSE_TASK_N_JOBS</var>: This can be used to control the number of
    processes <code>fcm make</code> would use in parallel. (default=4)</p>

    <p><kbd>args</kbd> or the environment variable <var>ROSE_TASK_OPTIONS</var>:
    This can be used to pass extra arguments to the <code>fcm make</code>
    command.</p>

    <p>E.g.:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
meta=fcm_make
mode=fcm_make
opt.jobs=8
</pre>

    <h2 id="rose-task-run.util.rose_ana">Built-in Application: rose_ana</h2>

    <p>This built-in application runs <code>rose-ana</code>, the Rose
    comparison engine. This compares files against each other using a
    configurable method and reports whether the files differ or not.</p>

    <p>In automatic selection mode, this built-in application will be invoked
    automatically if a task has a name that starts with
    <code>rose_ana*</code>.</p>

    <p>The built-in application will search the <code>comparisons</code>
    subdirectory of the Rose installation for built-in comparisons, and further
    directories to search can be specified in the <code>rose.conf</code> file
    using the <var>method-path</var> variable in the <var>[rose-ana]</var>
    section.</p>

    <h2 id="rose-task-run.util.rose_arch">Built-in Application: rose_arch</h2>

    <p>This built-in application provides a generic solution to configure site
    specific archiving of suite files. It is designed to work under <code>rose
    task-run</code>.</p>

    <p>In automatic selection mode, this built-in application will be invoked
    automatically if a task has a name that starts with
    <code>rose_arch*</code>.</p>

    <p>The application is normally configured in a <var>rose-app.conf</var>.
    Global settings may be specified in an <kbd>[arch]</kbd> section. Each
    archiving target will have its own <kbd>[arch:TARGET]</kbd> section for
    specific settings, where <var>TARGET</var> would be a URI to the archiving
    location on your site specific archiving system. Settings in a
    <kbd>[arch:TARGET]</kbd> section would override those in the global
    <kbd>[arch]</kbd> section for the given <var>TARGET</var>.</p>

    <p>The application provides some useful functionalities:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Incremental mode. Store the archive target settings, checksums of
      source files and the return code of archive command. In a retry, it would
      only redo targets that did not succeed in the previous attempts.</li>

      <li>Rename of source files.</li>

      <li>Tar-Gzip or Gzip source files before sending them to the
      archive.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following settings are accepted in <kbd>[arch]</kbd> and
    <kbd>[arch:TARGET]</kbd> sections:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><kbd>command-format=FORMAT</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Compulsory. A Pythonic <code>printf</code> style format string to
      construct the archive command. It must contain the placeholders
      <var>%(sources)s</var> and <var>%(target)s</var> for substitution of the
      sources and the target respectively.</dd>

      <dt><kbd>compress=pax|tar|pax.gz|tar.gz|tgz|gz</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Optional. If specified, compress source files to the given scheme
      before sending them to the archive. If not specified, the compress scheme
      is automatically determined by the file extension of the target, if it
      matches one of the allowed values. For the <var>pax|tar</var> scheme, the
      sources will be placed in a TAR archive before being sent to the target.
      For the <var>pax.gz|tar.gz|tgz</var> scheme, the sources will be placed
      in a TAR-GZIP file before being sent to the target. For the <var>gz</var>
      scheme, each source file will be compressed by GZIP before being sent to
      the target.</dd>

      <dt><kbd>rename-format</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Optional. If specified, the source files will be renamed according to
      the specified format. The format string should be a Pythonic
      <code>printf</code> style format string. It may contain the placeholder
      <var>%(cycle)s</var> (for the current <var>$ROSE_TASK_CYCLE_TIME</var>,
      the placeholder <var>%(name)s</var> for the name of the file, and/or
      named placeholders that are generated by <kbd>rename-parser</kbd>.</dd>

      <dt><kbd>rename-parser</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Optional. Ignored if <kbd>rename-format</kbd> is not specified.
      Specify a regular expression to parse the name of a source. The regular
      expression should do named captures of strings from source file names,
      which can then be used to substitute named placeholders in the
      corresponding <kbd>rename-format</kbd>.</dd>

      <dt><kbd>source=NAME</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Compulsory for each <kbd>[arch:TARGET]</kbd> section. Specify a list
      of space delimited source file names and/or globs for matching source
      file names. (File names with space or quote characters can be escaped
      using quotes or backslashes, like in a shell.) Paths are assumed to be
      relative to <var>$ROSE_SUITE_DIR</var> or to
      <var>$ROSE_SUITE_DIR/PREFIX</var> if <kbd>source-prefix=PREFIX</kbd> is
      specified.</dd>

      <dt><kbd>source-edit-format=FORMAT</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Optional. A Pythonic <code>printf</code> style format string to
      construct a command to edit or modify the content of source files before
      archiving them. It must contain the placeholders <var>%(in)s</var> and
      <var>%(out)s</var> for substitution of the path to the source file and the
      path to the modified source file (which will be created in a temporary
      working directory).</dd>

      <dt><kbd>source-prefix=PREFIX</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Optional. Add a prefix to each value in a source declaration. A
      trailing slash should be added for a directory. Paths are assumed to be
      relative to <var>$ROSE_SUITE_DIR</var>. This setting serves 2 purposes.
      It provides a way to avoid typing the same thing repeatedly. It also
      modifies the name-spaces of the sources if the target is in a TAR or
      TAR-GZIP file. In the absence of this setting, the name of a source in a
      TAR or TAR-GZIP file is the path relative to <var>$ROSE_SUITE_DIR</var>.
      By specifying this setting, the source names in a TAR or TAR-GZIP file
      will be shortened by the prefix.</dd>

      <dt><kbd>target-prefix=PREFIX</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Optional. Add a prefix to each target declaration. This setting
      provides a way to avoid typing the same thing repeatedly. A trailing
      slash (or whatever is relevant for the archiving system) should be added
      for a directory.</dd>

      <dt><kbd>update-check=md5sum|mtime+size</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Optional. Specify the method for checking whether a source has changed
      since the previous run. The default is to use the MD5 checksum of the
      content of each source file. The alternate method is to use the modified
      time and size of the source, which is useful for large files, but is less
      correct.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="rose-task-run.util.rose_prune">Built-in Application: rose_prune</h2>

    <p>This built-in application offers a way to housekeep a cycling suite. It
    prunes files and directories generated by suite tasks. It is designed to
    work under <code>rose task-run</code> on the host that runs the suite
    daemon.</p>

    <p>In automatic selection mode, this built-in application will be invoked
    automatically if a task has a name that starts with
    <code>rose_prune*</code>.</p>

    <p>The application is normally configured in the <kbd>[prune]</kbd> section
    in a <var>rose-app.conf</var>.</p>

    <p>All settings are expressed as a space delimited list of cycles, normally
    as date/time offsets relative to the current cycle, in a format recognised
    by the <code>--offset=OFFSET</code> option of <code>rose date</code>. E.g.
    <kbd>-1d6h</kbd> is 1 day and 6 hours before the current cycle time.</p>

    <p>The cycles of some settings also accept an optional argument followed by
    a colon. In these, the argument should be globs for matching items in the
    directory. If two or more globs are required, they should be separated by a
    space. In which case, either the argument should be quoted or the space
    should be escaped by a backslash.</p>

    <p>The following settings are accepted:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><kbd>prune-remote-logs-at=cycle ...</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Re-sync remote job logs at these cycles and remove them from remote
      hosts.</dd>

      <dt><kbd>archive-logs-at=cycle ...</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Archive all job logs at these cycles. Remove remote job logs on
      success.</dd>

      <dt><kbd>prune-work-at=cycle[:globs] ...</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Remove the work directories of the specified cycles. If globs are
      specified for a cycle, only items matching the globs in the work
      directories of the specified cycle will be pruned.</dd>

      <dt><kbd>prune-datac-at=cycle[:globs] ...</kbd></dt>

      <dd>Remove the <var>ROSE_DATAC</var> of the specified cycles. If globs
      are specified for a cycle, only items matching the globs in the
      <var>ROSE_DATAC</var> directories of the specified cycle will be
      pruned.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>E.g.:</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-rose_conf">
meta=rose_prune
mode=rose_prune

[prune]
prune-remote-logs-at=-6h
archive-logs-at=-1d
prune-work-at=-12h
prune-datac-at=-6h:foo* -12h:'bar* *.baz*' -1d
</pre>

    <h2 id="rose-task-env">rose task-env</h2>

    <p>There are times when extra environment needs to be defined before
    launching <code>rose task-run</code>. This is where <code>rose
    task-env</code> may come in handy. The command prints to the
    <var>STDOUT</var> the standard Rose task environment variables (which are
    normally provided by <code>rose task-run</code>) in a syntax compatible to
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a> / <a href=
    "http://www.kornshell.com/">ksh</a>. This means that the output of this
    command can be shell <code>eval</code> into the current environment.
    E.g.</p>
    <pre class="shell">
eval $(rose task-env)
</pre>

    <p>See <a href="rose-command.html#rose-task-env">Rose Reference Guide: CLI
    &gt; rose task-env</a> for a full list of environment variables provided by
    this command.</p>

    <h2 id="rose-app-run">rose app-run</h2>

    <p>Run an application according to its configuration, outside of a
    suite task environment. Although you will normally launch a Rose
    application using <code>rose task-run</code>, there are situations when
    you may have a standalone Rose application configuration that you just
    want to run outside of a suite. This is where <code>rose app-run</code>
    may come in handy.</p>

    <p>See <a href="rose-command.html#rose-app-run">Rose Reference Guide:
    CLI &gt; rose app-run</a> for a full list of environment variables
    provided by this command.</p>
