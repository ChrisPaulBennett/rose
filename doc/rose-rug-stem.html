              <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

              <p>This part of the Rose user guide explains how to
              use the <samp>rose stem</samp> testing system, and
              the motivation behind it.</p>

              <p><samp>rose stem</samp> requires the use of
              <a href="https://github.com/metomi/fcm">FCM</a> as it
              requires some of the version control information.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

              <p>Why do we test code?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Motivation II</h3>

              <p>Most people would answer something along the lines
              of "so we know it works".</p>

              <p>However, this is really asking two related but
              separate questions.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Does the code do what I meant it to do?</li>

                <li>Does the code do anything I didn't mean it to
                do?</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Motivation III</h3>

              <p>Answering the first question may involve writing a
              bespoke test and checking the results. The second
              question can at least partially be answered by using
              an automated testing system which runs predefined
              tasks and presents the answers. <samp>rose
              stem</samp> is a system for doing this.</p>

              <p><em>N.B. When writing tests for new code, they
              should be added to the testing system so that future
              developers can be confident that they haven't broken
              the new functionality.</em></p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="rose-stem">Rose Stem</h2>

              <p>There are two components in rose stem:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><samp>rose stem</samp> - the command line tool
                which executes an appropriate suite.</li>

                <li><samp>rose ana</samp> - a Rose task app which
                can compare the result of a task against a
                control.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>We will describe each in turn. It is intended that
              a test suite lives alongside the code in the same
              version-controlled project, which should encourage
              developers to update the test suite when they update
              the code. This means that the test suite will always
              be a valid test of the code it is accompanying.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="running-rose-stem">Running a suite with <samp>rose
              stem</samp></h2>

              <p>The <code>rose stem</code> command is essentially
              a wrapper to <code>rose suite-run</code>, which
              accepts some additional arguments and converts them
              to Jinja2 variables which the suite can
              interpret.</p>

              <p>These arguments are:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><code>--source</code> - specifies a source tree
                to include in a suite.</li>

                <li><code>--group</code> - specifies a group of
                tasks to run.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>A <em>group</em> is a set of Rose tasks which
              together test a certain configuration of a
              program.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="the-source-argument">The <code>--source</code>
                argument</h2>

              <p>The source argument provides a set of Jinja2
              variables which can then be included in any
              compilation tasks in a suite. You can specify
              multiple <code>--source</code> arguments on the
              command line. For example:</p>
              <pre>
rose stem --source=/path/to/workingcopy --source=fcm:other_project_tr@head
</pre>

              <p>Each source tree is associated with a project (via an
              <samp>fcm</samp> command) when <code>rose stem</code> is run
              on the command line. This project name is then used in the
              construction of the Jinja2 variable names.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Source II</h3>

              <p>Each project has a Jinja2 variable <code>SOURCE_FOO</code>
              where FOO is the project name. This contains a space-separated
              list of all sourcetrees belonging to that project, which can
              then be given to an appropriate build task in the suite so it
              builds those source trees.</p>
              
              <p>Similarly, a <code>HOST_SOURCE_FOO</code> variable is also
              provided. This is identical to <code>SOURCE_FOO</code> except
              any working copies have the local hostname prepended. This is
              to assist building on remote machines.</p>

              <p>The first source specified must be a working copy which
              contains the <samp>rose stem</samp> suite. The suite is
              expected to be in a subdirectory named <code>rose-stem</code>
              off the top of the working copy. This source is used to
              generate three additional variables:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><code>SOURCE_FOO_BASE</code> - the base directory of
                the project</li>

                <li><code>HOST_SOURCE_FOO_BASE</code> - the base directory
                of the project with the hostname prepended if it is a
                working copy</li>

                <li><code>SOURCE_FOO_REV</code> - the revision of the
                project (if any)</li>
              </ul>

              <p>These settings <b>override</b> the variables in the
              <code>rose-suite.conf</code> file.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Source III</h3>

              <p>These should allow the use of configuration files which
              control the build process inside the working copy, e.g. you
              can refer to:</p>
              <pre>
      {{HOST_SOURCE_FOO_BASE}}/fcm-make/configs/machine.cfg{{SOURCE_FOO_REV}}
</pre>

              <p>If you omit the source argument, <samp>rose
              stem</samp> defaults to assuming</p>
              <pre>
rose stem --source=.
</pre>

              <p>viz. that the current directory is part of the
              working copy which should be added as a source
              tree.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">Source IV</h3>

              <p>The project to which a source tree belongs is
              normally automatically determined using FCM commands.
              However, in the case where the source tree is not a
              valid FCM URL, or where you wish to assign it to
              another project, you can specify this using the
              <code>--source</code> argument:</p>
              <pre>
rose stem --source=foo=/path/to/source
</pre>

              <p>assigns the URL <code>/path/to/source</code> to
              the <samp>foo</samp> project, so the variables
              <samp>SOURCE_FOO</samp> and
              <samp>SOURCE_FOO_BASE</samp> will be set to
              <code>/path/to/source</code>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="the-group-argument">The <code>--group</code>
                argument</h2>

              <p>The group argument is used to provide a Pythonic
              list of groups in the variable <samp>RUN_NAMES</samp>
              which can then be looped over in a suite to switch
              sets of tasks on and off.</p>

              <p>Each <code>--group</code> argument adds another
              group to the list. For example:</p>
              <pre>
rose stem --group=mygroup --group=myothergroup
</pre>

              <p>runs two groups named <em>mygroup</em> and
              <em>myothergroup</em> with the current working copy.
              The suite will then interpret these into a set of
              tasks which build with the given source tree(s), run
              the program, and compare the output.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3>The <code>--task</code> argument</h3>

              <p>The <code>--task</code> argument is provided as a
              synonym for <code>--group</code>. Depending on how
              exactly the <samp>rose stem</samp> suite works users
              may find one of these arguments more intuitive to use
              than the other.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h2 id="rose-ana">Comparing output with <samp>rose
              ana</samp></h2>

              <p>Any task beginning with <i>rose_ana_</i> will be
              interpreted by Rose as a <samp>rose ana</samp> task,
              and run through the <samp>rose ana</samp> task
              app.</p>

              <p>A <samp>rose ana</samp> <code>rose-app.conf</code>
              file contains a series of blocks which each contain
              the names of two files to compare, a method of
              extracting the data from the file, and a method to
              compare the data. Each block is given a
              human-readable description of the test.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana II</h3>

              <p>For example:</p>
              <pre>
  [Compare data from myfile]
  comparison=Exact
  extract=OutputGrepper:'data value:(\d+)'
  kgo1file=/data/kgo/myfile
  resultfile=../run.1/myfile
</pre>

              <p>This tells <samp>rose ana</samp> to take the
              contents of the file <code>../run.1/myfile</code>
              (which is relative to the <samp>rose ana</samp>
              task's <code>work</code> directory) and the contents
              of <code>/data/kgo/myfile</code> and run the built-in
              OutputGrepper method on each file. This particular
              method runs an arbitrary regular expression on the
              file, producing a list of items which match the first
              group. In this case, the regular expression is
              <code>data value:(\d+)</code>. The comparison method
              is exact, so anything other than an exact match will
              cause a failure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana III</h3>

              <p>It is possible to add additional comparison and
              extraction methods to <samp>rose ana</samp> by
              setting the <code>method-path</code> variable in the
              <code>rose ana</code> section of the
              <code>rose.conf</code> file.</p>

              <p>A list of available methods can be found by
              listing the contents of the
              <code>lib/python/rose/apps/comparisons</code>
              subdirectory inside your <samp>Rose</samp>
              installation. The default installation includes:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><samp>OutputGrepper</samp> - an extraction
                method for running regular expressions on
                files</li>

                <li><samp>Exact</samp> - a comparison method for
                comparing two lists are identical</li>

                <li><samp>Within</samp> - a comparison method for
                comparing that the contents of one list are within
                a certain percentage or range of the other. This
                uses an additional <code>tolerance</code> value in
                the <code>rose-app.conf</code> file</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="slide">
              <h3 class="alwayshidden">rose ana IV</h3>

              <p>There are two further comparison methods which use
              the OutputGrepper extraction method to check whether
              particular strings exist in a file or not. These
              operate only the the <code>resultfile</code>
              variable, no KGO file is needed. The methods are:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><samp>Mandatory</samp> - will fail if the text
                specified in OutputGrepper is not present in the
                file.</li>

                <li><samp>Prohibited</samp> - will fail if the text
                specified in OutputGrepper is present in the
                file.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 id="rose-ana-db">The <samp>rose ana</samp>
              comparison database</h2>

              <p>In addition to performing the comparisons each of
              the <code>rose ana</code> tasks in the suite will
              append some key details about the comparisons to an
              <code>sqlite</code> database kept in the suite's
              <code>log</code> directory (at
              <code>log/rose-ana-comparisons.db</code>).</p>

              <p>This is intended to provide a quick means to
              interrogate the suite for information about the
              status of any comparisons it has performed. There are
              2 tables present in the suite which contain the
              following:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><samp>app_task (TEXT)</samp> A composite of
                    the exact name of the <code>rose ana</code>
                    task and the comparison section name from the
                    app defintion (in brackets).</li>

                    <li><samp>kgo_file (TEXT)</samp> The full path
                    to the file given as <code>kgo1file</code> in
                    the app definition.</li>

                    <li><samp>suite_file (TEXT)</samp> The full
                    path to the file given as
                    <code>resultfile</code> in the app
                    definition.</li>

                    <li><samp>status (TEXT)</samp> The status of
                    the task, as reported by <code>rose ana</code>
                    (i.e. " OK ", "FAIL" or "WARN").</li>

                    <li><samp>comparison (TEXT)</samp> Another
                    composite, this time it contains the
                    <code>comparison</code> and
                    <code>extract</code> in the app definition,
                    delimited by colons.</li>
                  </ul>The intention of this table is to provide a
                  record of which files were compared by which
                  tasks, how they were compared and what the result
                  of the comparison was.

              <p>Although this database is produced by a <code>rose
              stem</code> suite, the system does not provide any
              direct methods for working with or interrogating it -
              since there could be various reasons for doing so,
              and there may be other suite-design factors to
              consider. Users are therefore expected to provide
              this functionality separately based on their specific
              needs.</p>
