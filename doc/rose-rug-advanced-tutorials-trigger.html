      <h1>Rose Advanced Tutorial: trigger</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="handout" id="content"></div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

      <p>This part of the Rose user guide walks you through using the
      <a href="rose-configuration.html#meta.conf.behaviour">Configuration Metadata</a>
      setting <samp>trigger</samp>.</p>

      <p>This is used to decide whether settings are relevant, based on the value or
      state of other settings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

      <p><samp>trigger</samp> is fundamentally intended to cut down the amount
      of irrelevant settings presented to the user.</p>

      <p>Irrelevant (<samp>ignored</samp> or <samp>trigger-ignored</samp>)
      settings do not get included in output files at runtime. In effect, they
      are commented out (<samp>!</samp> or <samp>!!</samp> prefix in Rose
      configurations).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2 id="example">Example</h2>

      <p>In this example, we'll be ordering pizza.</p>

      <p>Create a new directory, containing a <samp>rose-app.conf</samp> file
      that looks like <a href="../etc/rose-rug-advanced-tutorials-trigger/rose-app.conf.html">this</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Example Metadata</h3>
      
      <p>We'll add some metadata to make it nice. Create a <samp>meta</samp>
      sub-directory with a <samp>rose-meta.conf</samp> file that looks like
      <a href="../etc/rose-rug-advanced-tutorials-trigger/meta/rose-meta.conf.html">this</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Once you've done that, run <samp>rose edit</samp> in the application
      directory and navigate around the pages.</p>
      
      <p>There are quite a lot of settings that are only relevant in certain contexts -
      for example, <samp>namelist:pizza_order=extra_chicken</samp> is pretty irrelevant
      if we're ordering a <samp>'Veggie Supreme'</samp>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Adding Triggers</h3>

      <p>Let's add some <samp>trigger</samp> information.</p>
      
      <p>Under <samp>[namelist:pizza_order=pizza_type]</samp>, add:</p>
      <pre>
trigger=namelist:pizza_order=extra_chicken: 'BBQ Chicken';
        namelist:pizza_order=pepperoni_multiple: 'Pepperoni', 'BBQ Chicken'
</pre>
      <p>This states which values of <samp>pizza_type</samp> are relevant for
      which settings. This means that <samp>extra_chicken</samp> is only
      relevant when <samp>pizza_type</samp> is 'BBQ Chicken' - otherwise, it
      should be in an <samp>ignored</samp> state. <samp>pepperoni_multiple</samp>
      is relevant for more than one value of <samp>pizza_type</samp>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Adding Logical Expression Triggers</h3>
      
      <p>We should also make sure we don't order over our budget,
      especially by splashing out on truffles. Add
      the following to <samp>[env=BUDGET]</samp>:</p>
      <pre>
trigger=namelist:pizza_order=truffle: this > 25;
        namelist:side_order: this >= 10
</pre>
      <p>What we've done here is used a small subset of the Rose configuration
      metadata logical syntax to specify a range of
      allowed values (the <samp>this > 25</samp> part).
      Here, <samp>this</samp> is a placeholder for the value
      of <samp>env=BUDGET</samp>; the expression syntax is essentially
      <a href="rose-rug-in-depth-topics.html#logicsyntax">Pythonic</a>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Adding Triggers - sections</h3>
 
      <p>We've also specified a section <samp>namelist:side_order</samp> in the
      trigger, which is perfectly valid - this means that the whole section
      and its options will be <samp>ignored</samp> when the value of <samp>env=BUDGET</samp> is below
      <samp>10</samp>. The truffle option will be ignored unless <samp>env=BUDGET</samp>
      is more than 25.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Fixing triggers</h3>
      
      <p>If we load the config editor (or reload the metadata) again, we
      should get some trigger errors. These essentially say that some of
      our settings are in the wrong state now - in our case, they should be
      <samp>trigger-ignored</samp>.</p>
      
      <p>You can fix them on the command line by running
      <code>rose macro --fix</code> or <code>rose macro -F</code> - this is
      what you would do if you were working with a text editor and made
      changes to values.</p>
      
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Fixing triggers in the config editor</h3>
      
      <p>Similarly, you can run "Autofix" in the config editor. You can do this
      in a couple of ways:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>the toolbar button</li>
        <li>the <kbd>Metadata -&gt; Autofix all configurations</kbd> menu</li>
        <li>the right click menu for the root page in the left hand tree panel</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Run "Autofix".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Results</h3>
      
      <p>If you accept the changes, the state of these settings will be
      corrected - if you go to the page, you'll see that they've vanished!
      They're actually just commented out, and viewable via the menu
      <kbd>View -&gt; All Ignored Variables</kbd>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Results - changing things</h3>
      <p>Try altering the values of <samp>namelist:pizza_order=pizza_type</samp>
      and <samp>env=BUDGET</samp> - with <kbd>View -&gt; All Ignored Variables</kbd> on and off.
      This should enable and trigger-ignore different
      settings.</p>
      
      <p>When <samp>env=BUDGET</samp> is below 10, the <samp>namelist:side_order</samp>
      section will be <samp>trigger-ignored</samp>, and the <samp>garlic_bread</samp> and <samp>soft_drink</samp>
      will be <samp>section-ignored</samp> - ignored because their parent section
      is ignored.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Results - hover-over</h3>
      
      <p>You can get more information about why an option is ignored in the config editor
      by hovering over its ignored flag, or looking at the option's menu button
      <kbd>Info</kbd> entry.</p>
      
      <p>Setting ids mentioned in the Info dialog are usually clickable links,
      so you can go directly to the relevant id.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Multiple Inheritance</h3>
      
      <p>More than one setting can decide whether something is relevant. In that case,
      the subject is relevant only if all the parents agree that it is - an AND relationship.</p>
      
      <p>For example, we already have one trigger for <samp>namelist:pizza_order=truffle</samp> (<samp>env=BUDGET</samp>) - but it should also only be relevant when <samp>namelist:pizza_order=no_mushrooms</samp> is <samp>.false.</samp>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Multiple Inheritance example</h3>
      
      <p>Open the metadata file in a text editor, and add the following to the
      <samp>[namelist:pizza_order=no_mushrooms]</samp> metadata section:</p>
      <pre>
trigger=namelist:pizza_order=truffle: .false.
</pre>
     
      <p>This means that the <samp>namelist:pizza_order=truffle</samp> option will only
      be enabled when <samp>env=BUDGET</samp> is greater than <samp>25</samp> (our older trigger)
      <strong>and</strong> <samp>namelist:pizza_order=no_mushrooms</samp> is <samp>.false.</samp>.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Multiple Inheritance testing</h3> 
      
      <p>Save the metadata file and reload the metadata in the config editor, and test it
      for yourself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Cascading Triggering</h3>
      
      <p>Triggering is not just based on values - if a setting is missing or <samp>trigger-ignored</samp>,
      any settings that it triggers will be <samp>trigger-ignored</samp> by default.</p>
      
      <p>This is another way of saying if something is irrelevant, all the settings that depend
      on it should also be irrelevant. This means that triggers can act in a cascade - A triggers
      B triggers C.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Cascading Triggering example</h3>
      
      <p>We can see this by replacing the <samp>env=BUDGET</samp> trigger with:</p>
      <pre>
trigger=namelist:pizza_order=truffle: this > 25;
        namelist:side_order: this >= 10;
        namelist:pizza_order=pizza_type: this >= 5
</pre>
      <p>When <samp>env=BUDGET</samp> is less than 5, <samp>namelist:pizza_order=pizza_type</samp>
      will be <samp>trigger-ignored</samp>. This means that all of its triggered settings like
      <samp>namelist:pizza_order=extra_chicken</samp> are irrelevant and will also be
      <samp>trigger-ignored</samp>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Cascading Triggering continued</h3>
      
      <p>Save, reload, and try changing <samp>env=BUDGET</samp> below <samp>5</samp>
      to see what it does to the options in <samp>namelist:pizza_order</samp>.</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3>Triggering (state)</h3>

      <p>There's also another way to express a trigger - you don't have
      to express a value or range of values in a trigger
      expression.</p>
      
      <p>Quite often you only want a setting to be <samp>trigger-ignored</samp>
      or enabled purely based on the availability of another setting - is it present and enabled?
      You might not care what particular value it has.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Triggering (non-value)</h3>
      
      <p>This can be expressed by adding a trigger but omitting the value part
      of the syntax. Let's add an option that we can use.</p>
      
      <p>Add a new variable in the metadata by adding these lines to the
      metadata file:</p>
      <pre>
[namelist:pizza_order=dip_type]
values='Garlic','Sour Cream','Salsa','Brown Sauce','Mustard'
</pre>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Triggering (non-value) example</h3>
      
      <p>We should add a trigger expression as well - replace the <samp>[namelist:pizza_order=pizza_type]</samp>
      trigger with:</p>
      <pre>
trigger=namelist:pizza_order=extra_chicken: 'BBQ Chicken';
        namelist:pizza_order=pepperoni_multiple: 'Pepperoni', 'BBQ Chicken';
        namelist:pizza_order=dip_type
</pre>
      <p>This means that <samp>namelist:pizza_order=dip_type</samp> is dependent
      on <samp>namelist:pizza_order=pizza_type</samp>, and will only
      be ignored when that is ignored - but the value of <samp>pizza_type</samp> doesn't matter to it.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Triggering (non-value) example continued</h3>
      
      <p>Save the file and reload the metadata in the config editor. We'll need
      to add the <samp>namelist:pizza_order=dip_type</samp> to use it properly:
      you can do this from the <samp>namelist:pizza_order</samp> page in a
      couple of ways (e.g. <kbd>Add</kbd> toolbar button, right click page menu),
      but it's more informative to do it via enabling the <kbd>View</kbd> menu option
      <kbd>View Latent Variables</kbd>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="slide">
      <h3 class="alwayshidden">Triggering (non-value) latent variables</h3>
 
      <p>After enabling the view, you should see <samp>extra_dip</samp> appear as
      an option that could be added. It will already have the correct triggered
      state (the same state as <samp>namelist:pizza_order=pizza_type</samp>) -
      verify for yourself that this works! You can then just add it via the
      menu button for the option.</p> 
    </div>
